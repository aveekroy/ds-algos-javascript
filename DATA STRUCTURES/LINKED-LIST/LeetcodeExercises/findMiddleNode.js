// PROBLEM STATEMENT:

// LL: Find Middle Node ( ** Interview Question)
// Implement a member function called findMiddleNode() that finds and returns the middle node of the linked list.

// Note: this LinkedList implementation does not have a length member variable.

// INPUT:

// Suppose you have a LinkedList object, list, with the following values:
// 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
// The middle node should have the value 3.

// Now suppose you have a LinkedList object, list, with the following values:
// 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6
// The middle node should have the value 4.

// OUTPUT:

// Return the middle node of the linked list.
// If the list has an even number of nodes, return the second middle node (the one closer to the end).
// Constraints:
// You are not allowed to use any additional data structures (such as arrays) or modify the existing data structure.
// You can only traverse the linked list once.

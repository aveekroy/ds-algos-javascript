// Used mainly in tree and graph traversal

// Check the implementations in DFS & BFS - Under Data Strctures -> TREES -> Traversal

// When to Use:
// - Problems involving exploring all possible paths or components in a graph or tree.
// - Problems requiring backtracking or exhaustive search.

// Tips:
// - Use recursion for simplicity in implementation, but be cautious about stack overflow for large graphs or trees.
// - Implement an iterative approach using a stack for better performance and to handle large graphs or trees.
